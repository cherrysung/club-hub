            This web app is designed to provide students with a view of all the
            clubs based on scheduling, subject focus, CAS strands, and MYP
            learning outcomes to help facilitate decision-making, help narrow
            down clubs based on interest, and recommend club choices. It allows
            students to gain a better understanding of which clubs to look out
            for ahead of the club fair while making their final decision via
            Google Form. Although it is a work in progress, the club hub aims to
            organize club selection for students using technology.
